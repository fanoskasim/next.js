The `expireTime` config is used to specify a custom `stale-while-revalidate` expire time for CDNs to consume in the `Cache-Control` header for ISR enabled pages.

The default value is `31536000` seconds (1 year).

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // one hour in seconds
  expireTime: 3600,
}
```

When sending the `Cache-Control` header, the expire time will be calculated depending on the specific revalidate period.

For example, if you have a revalidate of 15 minutes on a path and the expire time is one hour the generated `Cache-Control` header will be `s-maxage=900, stale-while-revalidate=2700` so that it can stay stale for 15 minutes less than the configured expire time.
