React Server Components allow you to write UI that can be rendered and optionally cached on the server. In Next.js, the rendering work is further split by route segments to enable streaming and partial rendering.

This page will go through how Server Components work and when you might use them.

## Benefits of Server Rendering

There are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the server, including:

- **Data Fetching**: Server Components allow you to move data fetching to the server, closer to your data source. This can improve performance by reducing time it takes to fetch data needed for rendering, and the number of requests the client needs to make.
- **Security**: Server Components allow you to keep sensitive data and logic on the server, such as tokens and API keys, without the risk of exposing them to the client.
- **Caching**: By rendering on the server, the result can be cached and reused on subsequent requests and across users. This can improve performance and reduce cost by reducing the amount of rendering and data fetching done on each request.
- **Performance**: Server Components give you additional tools to optimize performance from the baseline. For example, if you start with an app composed of entirely Client Components, moving non-interactive pieces of your UI to Server Components can reduce the amount of client-side JavaScript needed. This is beneficial for users with slower internet or less powerful devices, as the browser has less client-side JavaScript to download, parse, and execute.
- **Initial Page Load and [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/)**: On the server, we can generate HTML to allow users to view the page immediately, without waiting for the client to download, parse and execute the JavaScript needed to render the page.
- **Search Engine Optimization and Social Network Shareability**: The rendered HTML can be used by search engine bots to index your pages and social network bots to generate social card previews for your pages.
- **Streaming**: Server Components allow you to split the rendering work into chunks and stream them to the client as they become ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page earlier without having to wait for the entire page to be rendered on the server.

## Using Server Components in Next.js

By default, Next.js uses Server Components. This allows you to automatically implement server rendering with no additional configuration, and you can opt into using Client Components when needed, see [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).

## How are Server Components rendered?

On the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks: by individual route segments and [Suspense Boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).

Each chunk is rendered in two steps:

1. React renders Server Components into a special data format called the **React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload)**.
2. Next.js uses the RSC Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render **HTML** on the server.

Then, on the client:

1. The HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route - this is for the initial page load only.
2. The React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.
3. The JavaScript instructions are used to [hydrate](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) Client Components and make the application interactive.

> #### What is the React Server Component Payload (RSC)?
>
> The RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The RSC Payload contains:
>
> - The rendered result of Server Components
> - Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files
> - Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component
